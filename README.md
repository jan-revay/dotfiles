# My personal dotfiles


Dotfiles are managed via a bare git repository. This repo is meant to be used together with the [iniPC repo](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC), read the initPC repo README for more info.

This directory also contains scripts, but only such that do not need to be executed as a part of the [initPC script](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC) during init of a new machine.

"Dotfiles" is just a fancy name for UNIX config files <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles>
