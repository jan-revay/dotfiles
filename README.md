# My personal dotfiles


Dotfiles are managed via a bare git repository. This repo is meant to be used together with the [iniPC repo](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC), read the initPC repo README.md and [install_dotfiles.sh](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC/blob/devel/CommonInitScripts/install_dotfiles.sh) for more info.

This directory also contains scripts, but only such that do not need to be executed as a part of the [initPC script](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC) during init of a new machine.

"Dotfiles" is just a fancy name for personal config files <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles>

## Test proposals

- aliases should only be allowed to be merged to testing once they have been synchronized between all shells (PowerShell, zsh, fish, bash...)
- aliases should not fire `command unknown` error
- TODO - consider using this repo from root directory instead of just home

## TODO P1

## TODO P2

## TODO P3

- Rewrite/update/delete .my_scripts
