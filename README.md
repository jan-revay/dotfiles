# My personal dotfiles


Dotfiles managed in bare git repository. This repo is meant to be used together with the [iniPC repo](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC).

This directory also contains scripts, but only such that do not need to be executed as a part of the [initPC script](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC) during init of a new machine.

## Runes & test proposals

- aliases should only be allowed to be merged to testing once they have been synchronized between all shells (PowerShell, zsh, fish, bash...)

"Dotfiles" is just a fancy name for UNIX config files <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles>
